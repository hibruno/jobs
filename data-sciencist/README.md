## Data Scientist at Bruno

Hi ! You have successfully applied to our Data Scientist position. We are glad you are looking to join us. Before we go any further, we would like to look at this exercise so that we can better evaluate your data science skills.

Take your time. You don't have to do everything. You will then meet someone from the Bruno team to comment your work.

## Exercise

### Context

We are trying to forecast the future balance of one's account. We want to be able to forecast the balance on different time horizons. This forecast can then be used within other functions such as smart warnings or our microsaving feature.

### Data

The transactions.csv file has 1 year of historical transactions for about 100 Bruno users. Data in balances.csv is a snapshot of Bruno users current accounts as of February 22nd, 2019.
