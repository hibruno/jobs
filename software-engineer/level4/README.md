# Level 4

In case of an accident we apply a €800 [deductible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible).
We want to offer the driver the option to reduce the deductible amount from €800 to €150, for a few more euros per day.

The rule is simple: the driver is charged an additional 4€/day when she chooses the "deductible reduction" option.
**The money goes to us, not to the owner.**
